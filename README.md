# NLP - Data Preprocessing, Exploration, and Visualization (R)



- Loaded and explored the dataset, removing redundant columns and handling missing values
- Balanced the class attribute (Status) by adjusting each class to match the median status count (3888)
- Sampled the dataset by selecting 15% of the median value per class for consistency
- Applied NLP techniques, including term frequency (TF), word clouds, and TF-IDF, to analyze prominent words in each mental health status
- Calculated bigrams and created functions to count words and locate specific terms in the dataset
- Visualization (R):
  - Created interactive barcharts to visualize the TF, TF-IDF, Bigram for each mental health status
  - Generated word clouds to illustrate key terms across the entire dataset and by individual status
