# NLP - Data Preprocessing, Exploration, and Visualization (R)

    -Use of
### 1.1 Loaded and explored the dataset, removing redundant columns and handling missing values
### 1.2 Balanced the class attribute (Status) by adjusting each class to match the median status count (3888)
### 1.3 Sampled the dataset by selecting 15% of the median value per class for consistency
### 1.4 Preprocessing text data
### 2.1, 2.2, 2.3: Applied NLP techniques, including term frequency (TF), TF-IDF, and bigrams to analyze prominent words in each mental health status


- Calculated bigrams and created functions to count words and locate specific terms in the dataset
- Visualization (R):
  - Created interactive barcharts to visualize the TF, TF-IDF, Bigram for each mental health status
  - Generated word clouds to illustrate key terms across the entire dataset and by individual status
